# Idea

To develop a web application to record cryptocurrency transactions and their results.

# Current stage

Working api tested with postman.

Temporarily not available online!!!

Available at [crypto-diary.space](https://crypto-diary.space/) if I don't updating the build.
Server uses minimal nginx + cloudflare CDN configuration, as my skills grow the configuration will improve.
Data is erased after server reboot, API is not frozen! Current API 0.5.0. Clear the cache if the wrong version is shown or change the URL.

# TODO

- Frontend
- Backend tests
- Improve code base
