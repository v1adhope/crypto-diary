# Idea

To develop a web application to record cryptocurrency transactions and their results.

# Current stage

Working api tested with postman.
Available at [crypto-diary.space](https://crypto-diary.space/) if I don't updating the build.
Server uses minimal nginx + cloudflare CDN configuration, as my skills grow the configuration will improve.
Data is erased after server reboot, API is not frozen!

# TODO

- Frontend
- Backend tests
- Improve code base
